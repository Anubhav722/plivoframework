.. _plivo-synopsis:

Plivo can be used to build almost any kind of telephony application – from
simple click-to-call systems to complex applications like IVRs, Voice-mail
Systems, Billing Systems or even a full-fledged Call Center Application.

Plivo was born out of a desire to write telephony applications rapidly.
While Twilio solved that problem for many – we have always wished that app
developers wouldn’t be locked to their services. So we created Plivo –
a 100% FOSS framework built on the next generation telephony platform
`Freeswitch`_. While building Plivo, we have consciously kept our APIs as
consistent as possible with Twilio – allowing us to reuse Twilio’s helper
libraries so that developers can port their existing applications to Plivo
with minimal code modification. However, it must be noted that our code
base is in no way related to Twilio.
