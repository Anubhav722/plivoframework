##About

Telephonie is a gevent-based Python framework for the FreeSWITCH's Event Socket.
The framework provides support for both Inbound and Outbound methods of the Event Socket.

Telephonie may be used for a wide variety of purposes (IVRs, Billing System, Voicemail Applications etc).

Telephonie is totally event-driven and allows easy implementation of complex applications in a simple and extensible manner.
It aims to export all the functionality of the FreeSWITCH to higher level applications.
